# Different machine learing algorithms and its explanation.
This repository contains most of the commonly used machine learning algorithm and its implementations. <br>

## Supervised Learning
Supervised Learning is a machine learning approach where the data are provided with labels, with that being said every data point has its meaning or name or tags.

### Regression
Regression analysis is the method which is used to find the relationship between independent variable with  continious output variables. <br>
